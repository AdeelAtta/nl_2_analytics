## How to Use This Dashboard

### For Agents
1. Pick an epic from the backlog
2. Read the epic definition from `/docs/epics/EP-XXX.md`
3. Read your agent spec from `/docs/agents/agent-*.md`
4. Find the corresponding task files in `/docs/tasks/`
5. Pick a task with status `backlog`
6. Update the task status to `in_progress`
7. Implement the task
8. Update the task status to `done`
9. Update this dashboard

### For Human Engineers
1. Review the Implementation-Plan.md for overall direction
2. Review epic definitions for scope
3. Review agent specs for team alignment
4. Update this dashboard with actual progress
5. Add new tasks as needed using the template

| Verification | ✅ Done | Backend: 40/40 tests pass (6 existing + 34 new), ruff clean, mypy clean. Frontend: build succeeds, lint passes. |

## Blockers / Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Research spikes could invalidate architecture assumptions | Three P0 spikes run before dependent epics start (EP-007, EP-008, EP-009) |
| Task count (~144) is high for initial planning | Only 12 are fully documented; remaining ~132 are listed in epic task tables and can be generated from templates |
| Multi-agent merge conflicts on `/backend/shared/` | Shared interfaces owned by no single agent; changes require README review |
| No git commits yet (Sprint 0 work unversioned) | `git add && git commit` needed before continuing to downstream epics |
| Makefile `make install` fails on Windows | Git Bash path issue with `cd backend && uv sync` — fix shell escaping |
